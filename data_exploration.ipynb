Air travel was restricted or prevented in the United States for several months following the attacks. Total losses to the United States Airline industry are unknown, but extremely high.

He also reported that a flight attendant was stabbed and said that the hijackers were flying the plane. United Flight 175 departed from Boston's Logan International Airport at 8:14 am local time. At 8:47 am, air traffic control received the first indications that the plane was hijacked. Since the airplane impacted the South Tower at 9:03 am, the length of the hijacking was at least 16 minutes. The second aircraft seized was United Airlines flight 175, which was scheduled to depart from Logan at 8:00 and fly directly to Los Angeles.

       "73127  This attack was one of four related incidents (cf. 200109110004-07). Flight attendant, Robert Fangman, called a United Airlines office in San Francisco and spoke with Marc Policastro. He reported the hijacking and said that both pilots had been killed. He also reported that a flight attendant was stabbed and said that the hijackers were flying the plane. United Flight 175 departed from Boston's Logan International Airport at 8:14 am local time. At 8:47 am, air traffic control received the first indications that the plane was hijacked. Since the airplane impacted the South Tower at 9:03 am, the length of the hijacking was at least 16 minutes. The second aircraft seized was United Airlines flight 175, which was scheduled to depart from Logan at 8:00 and fly directly to Los Angeles.

As the aircraft approached the Pentagon it clipped several street lamps, one of which fell onto a taxi cab, injuring the driver, Lloyd England. The aircraft's right wing hit a portable generator that provided backup power for the Pentagon and the left engine hit an external steam vault before it slammed into the Pentagon. American Airlines Flight 77 departed Washington Dulles International Airport at 8:20 am local time. The airplane was hijacked sometime between 8:51 and 8:54 am.

The passengers attempted to retake control of the airplane after receiving word that other hijacked aircraft had been crashed into the World Trade Center buildings in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The attackers evidentially gave the order to crash the plane once they realized they could not maintain control of the vehicle to carry out their mission. United Airlines Flight 93, departing from Newark International Airport at 8:42 am local time, crashed at 10:03 am. Air traffic controllers believed that the hijackers took over the airplane at 9:28 am, so the hijacking lasted for 35 minutes before Flight 93 crashed.   \n",
